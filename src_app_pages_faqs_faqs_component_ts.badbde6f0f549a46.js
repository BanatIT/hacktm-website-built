Bring your passion for IT and let\u2019s hack things started!</p><p>*If you are under 18 yo, your parents will have to fill out a form of approval. The form will be provided via email within 7 days before HackTM. Have your parents sign it and make sure you bring it with you on registration day! Otherwise you won't be able to check-in at the event location.</p><p>PS: if you don\u2019t feel like joining the event as a participant, you can check out HackTM as a visitor (we\u2019ll welcome you warmly anyways). </p>"},{question:"What will I find at HackTM?",answer:"<p>You will find like-minded individuals just like you, passionate about all-things-tech, industry experts and mentors ready to help you in case you get stuck while working on your project, judges who will evaluate your work and a bunch of friendly volunteers who are ready to help you with whatever is needed.</p><p>In addition, you will find food trucks, drink stands aka hydration stations (with juices, smoothies, coffee, tea and water), merchandise & swag corners, fun activities and entertaining moments powered by our sponsors and partners and, of course, a sleeping area with sleeping bags where you can take a power nap, rest and recharge.</p>"},{question:"What should I bring?",answer:"<p><strong>To have a great time</strong>: We try to provide a wide array of food options and beverages on location, available for free or at a cost. Although we provide a number of sleeping bags, they are in high demand, so it might be a good idea to bring your own. Other than that, pack lightly, according to your quirks and move in (or just go home to rest & recharge and come back when you feel ready to go at it again).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>To build your project</strong>: Make sure to bring all hardware equipment required to develop your project. This includes laptops, monitors, Raspberry Pi devices, Arduinos, charging cables and whatever gadgets you know are essential to building your project. Also, if your project requires a specific device and you don't have the possibility to purchase it, we can try to get it for you, if you let us know with at least a month in advance.&nbsp;</p>"},{question:"Does HackTM provide accommodation?",answer:"<p>A sleeping area with sleeping bags will be available on-location.

How do I register my team?",answer:"<p>All teams, even the one-(wo)man teams, will have to register on the NOW platform on the day of the event, before the judging starts*.</p><p>You'll get more details about the process soon!</p><p>*If you don't register your team on the NOW platform, you won't be taken into consideration for any of the prizes.
